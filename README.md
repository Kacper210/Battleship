# Battleship
1. First I decided that board will be square 100x100.  
2. Next I created classes which I named after ships in the game.  
3. All classes contain method to generate numbers.   
4. Each number means where the ship is positioned on the board (can be vertical or horizontal).   
5. Class Player1 and Player2 contain lists which stored the numbers.   
6. Player is trying to destroy second player ships.   
7. The game ends when player have no ships on the list.
